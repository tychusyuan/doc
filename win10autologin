Some users will not see above mentioned option in Windows 10 Settings app due to missing or incompatible hardware drivers.

Don't worry! You can take help of following registry tweak to restore "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer" checkbox:

1. Press WIN+R keys together to launch RUN dialog box. Now type regedit and press Enter. It'll open Registry Editor.

2. Now go to following key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\PasswordLess\Device

3. In right-side pane, look for DevicePasswordLessBuildVersion DWORD.

The value of this DWORD would be set to 2 in your device.

Double-click on DevicePasswordLessBuildVersion and change its value to 0

That's it. Now open "control userpasswords2" or "netplwiz" programs and you'll get "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer" checkbox back.

PS: If you don't want to modify Registry Editor manually or if you can't see above mentioned key in Registry, you can run following command in Command Prompt directly:

reg ADD "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\PasswordLess\Device" /v DevicePasswordLessBuildVersion /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f

It'll do the same job and bring back missing checkbox in Windows 10.
